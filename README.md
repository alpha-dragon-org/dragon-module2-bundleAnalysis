# Intro to Dragon Data-Modules

Dragon is a browser extension that visualizes the power concentrations of any token on the Solana blockchain. The extension is separated into "data-modules" that produce different analyses on a token's holders. This initial release includes four data-modules, and the module of focus for this bounty is:

**2. Bundle Analysis**  
- The concentration of all holders that used Jito bundles to purchase token supply with multiple wallets, executed in the same slot within a block.  
- The specific data to be analyzed includes total number of active bundles, total percentage held in active bundles, number of wallets per bundle, and more.  
- You can learn more about bundles from [this video](https://youtu.be/91k5QYdAprU?si=n0uGyhYk3EesIUdW) or from [Jito's documentation](https://docs.jito.wtf/lowlatencytxnsend/#bundles-api-v1-bundles).
  
Soon, developers will contribute their own modules to Dragon based on what they think is important for traders to know when in the trenches.

## Contribution Overview

Each of Dragon's first four modules currently gathers data by web-scraping TrenchyBot, TrenchRadar, and Bubblemaps. The task is to build a pipeline that connects the Token Info module with a Solana RPC (ie. [Helius](https://www.helius.dev)) and replace all scrapes. If any data can not be retrieved from the RPC, the developer can use whatever means necessary given the goals stated in [Bounty Details](#bounty-details) below.

By fetching real-time data directly from a node, Dragon will become an unbeatable companion in the trenches.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository.**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alpha-dragon-dev/dragon-module2-bundleAnalysis.git
   cd dragon-module2-bundleAnalysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies.**

   Install all required Node.js packages by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure the application.**

   Open `src/config/config.js` and update the following parameters as needed:

   - `API_SERVER_PORT` and `TELEGRAM_SERVER_PORT`: Set the ports for the API and Telegram servers.
   - `TELEGRAM_API_ID` and `TELEGRAM_API_HASH`: Replace with your Telegram API credentials.
   - `HELIUS_RPC_URL`: Update with your Helius RPC endpoint and API key. This endpoint is used for blockchain data queries.

4. **Run the servers.**

   Start the API server in one terminal:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   And then start the Telegram client (which also includes a small Express server) in another terminal:

   ```bash
   npm run telegram
   ```
5. **View results in testing environment.**

   Start the API server to fetch data from backend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```   

   View results on:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:8080/
   ```

## Module Details

- **Module Name:** Bundle Analysis 
- **Bounty:** 0.10% of $DRAGON supply  
- **Goals:** Retrieve all data below in real-time and with extremely high accuracy.

### Data To Fetch

- **Total # of active bundles**  
  The total number of Jito bundles that are actively holding any amount of token supply.  
   **Example Output:** `3`

- **Total % in active bundles**  
  The total amount of token supply actively held that was bought using a Jito bundle.  
   **Example Output:** `32.2`

- **Total # of inactive bundles**  
  The total number of Jito bundles that are no longer holding any amount of token supply, ie. have sold all holdings to 0%  
   **Example Output:** `2`

- **Metadata for each active bundle**

  - **# of wallets in bundle**  
  The number of distinct wallets within the bundle. There may be multiple values to fetch, depending on the total # of active bundles.  
  **Example Output:** `4`

  - **% total in bundle**  
  The amount of token supply that the bundle originally bought. There may be multiple values to fetch, depending on the total # of active bundles.  
  **Example Output:** `45.3`

  - **% active in bundle**  
  The amount of token supply actively held within the bundle. There may be multiple values to fetch, depending on the total # of active bundles.  
  **Example Output:** `30.0`

### Module Output

We have included a testing environment where you can see your live code displayed in the module. The live module will be interactive, meaning you can hover to reveal the metadata you retrieved for each bundle. *Note:* The module output only displays active bundles.

## Bounty Selection Criteria

We will select a recipient for this bounty based on the following criteria, in order of evaluation:
1. A fully complete retrieval of the data outlined in [Module Details](#module-details)
2. The highest accuracy for data retrieved in real-time
3. The fastest speed for data retrieval
4. If there is more than one developer to meet the above criteria, the first pull request will receive the bounty

At the discretion of the Dragon executive team, if the bounty is completed by combining the codes of multiple submissions AND there are no single submissions that meet all criteria, we may elect to split the bounty between the developers involved.

## Using Helius RPC for Integration

[Helius](https://www.helius.dev) is a powerful RPC service that enables quick and direct access to on-chain data on Solana. By integrating Helius RPC calls into Dragon's data-modules, we can **replace slow web-scraping techniques** and **increase data accuracy.** 

**How to update the code**
- **Modify the stub functions:** In files like `src/modules/tokenInfo.js` and `src/api/server.js`, update the stub implementations to call the appropriate Helius RPC endpoints.
- **Leverage the configured endpoints:** Use the `HELIUS_RPC_URL` from `src/config/config.js` to ensure that your RPC calls are directed to the correct endpoint with your API key.
- **Improve performance:** Integrate batching of RPC calls if necessary to further improve response time.

*Note:* If any data can not be retrieved from RPC, or if data can be faster retrieved via another method such as data streams, the developer can implement the alternative method with a brief explanation for their choice.

## Future Bounties

Dragon’s aim is to make token analyses more transparent and community-driven. After the initial four modules, bounties will expand to include more data-modules on holder analyses and deception analyses on token supply.

If you have an idea for a data-module that could benefit traders in the trenches, please propose it [here](https://github.com/alpha-dragon-org/dragon-module-openIdeas) to be considered for a bounty.
