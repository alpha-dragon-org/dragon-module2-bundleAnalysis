# Intro to Dragon Data-Modules

Dragon is a browser extension that visualizes the power concentrations of any token on the Solana blockchain. The extension is separated into "data-modules" that produce different analyses on a token's holders. Soon, developers will contribute their own modules to Dragon based on what they think is important for traders to know when in the trenches. 

The Alpha-Dragon includes four data-modules, and the module of focus for this bounty is:

**2. Bundle Analysis**  
- This module will visualize the concentration of all Jito bundles that purchased a token's supply. A Jito bundle is when you program multiple wallets to execute transactions within the same slot in a Solana block. The specific data to be retrieved includes total # of active bundles, total % in active bundles, some metadata per each bundle, and more. You can learn about bundles from [this video](https://youtu.be/91k5QYdAprU?si=n0uGyhYk3EesIUdW) or from [Jito's documentation](https://docs.jito.wtf/lowlatencytxnsend/#bundles-api-v1-bundles). You may also want to know that Jito hosts their own [bundle explorer](https://explorer.jito.wtf/bundle-explorer?sortBy=Tip).

## Contribution Overview

This module currently gathers data by web-scraping TrenchRadar. The task is to build a pipeline that connects this module with a Solana RPC (eg. [Helius](https://www.helius.dev)) and replace all scrapes. If any data can not be retrieved from RPC, the developer can use whatever means necessary given the goals stated in the [Module Details](#module-details) below.

If the data retrieved is as close to real-time as possible, Dragon will become an unbeatable companion in the trenches.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository.**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alpha-dragon-dev/dragon-module2-bundleAnalysis.git
   cd dragon-module2-bundleAnalysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies.**

   Install all required Node.js packages by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure the application.**

   Open `src/config/config.js` and update the following parameters as needed:

   - `API_SERVER_PORT` and `TELEGRAM_SERVER_PORT`: Set the ports for the API and Telegram servers.
   - `TELEGRAM_API_ID` and `TELEGRAM_API_HASH`: Replace with your Telegram API credentials.
   - `HELIUS_RPC_URL`: Update with your Helius RPC endpoint and API key. This endpoint is used for blockchain data queries.

4. **Run the servers.**

   Start the API server in one terminal:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   And then start the Telegram client (which also includes a small Express server) in another terminal:

   ```bash
   npm run telegram
   ```
5. **View results in testing environment.**

   Start the API server to fetch data from backend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```   

   View results on:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:8080/
   ```

## Module Details

- **Module Name:** Bundle Analysis 
- **Bounty:** 0.10% of $DRAGON supply  
- **Goals:** Retrieve all data below in real-time and with extremely high accuracy.

### Data To Fetch

- **Total % in active bundles**  
  The total amount of token supply that was bought using a Jito bundle and currently held in a wallet.  
   **Example Output:** `32.2`

- **Total # of active bundles**  
  The total number of bundled wallets that are still holding token supply.  
   **Example Output:** `3`

- **Metadata for each active bundle**

  - **% active in bundle**  
  The amount of token supply still held in the bundle. There may be multiple values to fetch, depending on the total # of active bundles.  
  **Example Output:** `30.0`
  
  - **% total in bundle**  
  The amount of token supply that the bundle originally bought. There may be multiple values to fetch, depending on the total # of active bundles.  
  **Example Output:** `45.3`

  - **# of wallets in bundle**  
  The number of distinct wallets within the bundle. There may be multiple values to fetch, depending on the total # of active bundles.  
  **Example Output:** `4`

- **Total # of inactive bundles**  
  The total number of Jito bundles that are no longer holding any amount of token supply, ie. have sold all holdings to 0%  
   **Example Output:** `2`

- **Metadata for each inactive bundle**

  - **% total in bundle**  
  The amount of token supply that the bundle originally bought. There may be multiple values to fetch, depending on the total # of inactive bundles.  
  **Example Output:** `7.8`

  - **# of wallets in bundle**  
  The number of distinct wallets in the bundle. There may be multiple values to fetch, depending on the total # of inactive bundles.  
  **Example Output:** `10`

### Module Output

We have included a testing environment where you can see your code displayed live in the module. The test module will be interactive, meaning you can hover to reveal the metadata per bundle. *Note:* The module output may only display active bundles.

## Bounty Selection Criteria

We will select a recipient for this bounty based on the following criteria, in order of evaluation:

1. A fully complete retrieval of the data outlined in [Module Details](#module-details)
2. The highest accuracy for data retrieved
3. The fastest speed for retrieval, updated within seconds to real-time
   
If there is more than one developer to meet the above criteria, the first pull request will receive the bounty.

## Integrating RPCs for Data Retrieval

[Helius](https://www.helius.dev) is an example of an RPC service that enables quick and direct access to on-chain data on Solana. By integrating RPCs into Dragon's data-modules, we can **replace slow web-scraping techniques** and **increase data accuracy.** 

**How to update the code (with Helius)**
- **Modify the stub functions:** In files like `src/modules/tokenInfo.js` and `src/api/server.js`, update the stub implementations to call the appropriate Helius RPC endpoints.
- **Leverage the configured endpoints:** Use the `HELIUS_RPC_URL` from `src/config/config.js` to ensure that your RPC calls are directed to the correct endpoint with your API key.
- **Improve performance:** Integrate batching of RPC calls if necessary to further improve response time.

*Note:* If any data can not be retrieved from RPC, or if data can be faster retrieved via another method such as data streams, the developer can implement the alternative method with a brief explanation for their choice.

## Future Bounties

Dragon’s aim is to make token analyses more transparent and community-driven. At the community's direction, bounties will expand to include more types of holder analyses and deception analyses on token supply.

If you have an idea for a data-module that could benefit traders in the trenches, please propose it in the discussion [here](https://github.com/alpha-dragon-org/dragon-module-openIdeas) to be considered for a bounty.
